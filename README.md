TextPuller
==========

TextPuller is an OSX Dashboard Widget that takes URLs with text and displays them.
It's like websnip that stretches to the length of text. TextPuller was developed 
to pull in the information from a cronned output of my TaskWarrior list.

"task list" is sent to a .txt. file every five minutes, and is available online 
for me to see. I feed this URL to TextPuller and can see it on my desktop. I 
don't like scrollbars, and WebSnip didn't work for me since it would cut off 
my text after the static length.

You can clone the repo and double-click the widget to install. Feel free to
